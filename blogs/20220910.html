            <p class="homepage-paragraph">I never thought I’d actually get around to creating this website. It’s been a project that I’ve meant to start several years ago, but to be honest, whenever the idea of designing this site resurfaced in my head, it would always be drowned out by a plethora of excuses. To me, the prospect of creating a website—a portfolio that represented who I am—appeared extravagant. It never seemed to be worth the time nor energy.</p>
            <p class="homepage-paragraph">I’ve just started my third year in college, and to this day, I regret not starting this project earlier. What once seemed like an onerous and banal task, reacquainting myself with HTML and CSS and writing personal essays about my experiences, is now a necessity.</p>
            <p class="homepage-paragraph">I look back at who I’ve become over the last couple of years, and I realized that I’ve never documented my journey. I never recorded my thoughts after finishing my first internship at Fidelity Investments. I never jotted down my insecurities—whether it’s my lackluster understanding of the industry I work in or my incessant need to obsess over my weight. I never catalogued my adventures working at the College of Computing nor have I recorded my experiences living on the Golden Coast this past summer.</p>
            <p class="homepage-paragraph">As my summer progressed, it became apparent that I needed to create this website: it’s a sanctuary for me to regurgitate my raw and unfiltered thoughts and publish it for the internet to see. Throughout my highest of highs and my lowest of lows, I found that jotting down my reflections was the best way for me to sort through my emotions, and I want to use this blog as a platform to document these experiences.</p>
            <p class="homepage-paragraph">I’ve learned that these very experiences shaped who I am today, and I would not be who I am without the unwavering support of my mentors, professors, and friends. A few months ago, I was fortunate to have connected with Jasmine Lawrence, an alumnus of the College of Computing who I consider to be a role model. As she reminisced about her college years, and in the process provided much-needed direction for my future, she mentioned that every experience and opportunity—regardless how insignificant or inconspicuous—was crucial in shaping her life.</p>
            <p class="homepage-paragraph">I suppose I’m no different.</p>
            <p class="homepage-paragraph">Looking back, I realize that this reflection is nothing more than a hodgepodge of aimless thoughts haphazardly strung together with no rhyme or reason. I think I’m fine with that though. I made a promise to myself that I can ramble and rant here if I need—that’s the beauty of a blog. It’s unstructured and unfiltered. </p>
            <p class="homepage-paragraph">A few closing notes about the website: having worked at Instagram over the summer, I’ve become obsessed with the color gradients that are featured in the Instagram logo. From the bright purple to the fiery reds and pinks overlaying the simplistic and geometric iconic camera icon, I wanted to replicate this minimalistic and modern style through my website. I am quite proud of the result, especially considering I retained my knowledge of HTML and CSS that have been dormant since middle school.</p>
            <p class="homepage-paragraph">I had a blast designing this website, and I’m beyond excited to use this as a safe-space for my most random reflections.</p>
